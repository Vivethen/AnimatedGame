- I believe that I have done the best of my ability for this project

- I got the github gift card from you for the most hours spent on khan academy because I spent a lot of my time at home learning about code and making my group’s game better.

- Even though the course is over I will still try to improve the game on my spare time over the summer.

- I have shown the game to some of my friends and cousins and put their feedback into the game

- I like how our game was able to use Alon’s music. I would like to add more sound effects like when you lose a life, kill an enemy or boss. Different music for the 5 different stages would be nice as well

Thanks for a great year, I hope to have you as my teacher in my future courses!

I feel like I contributed a lot and did everything to the best of my ability, 
I genuinely loved working on the game and would do it again in the future. 
A lot of the time I wished I could’ve done more at home. 
Only last saturday did I code 2 bosses that didn’t end up in the final showing of the game which made me mad at first but I cooled off and noticed that they were very complicated. 
Viv was a great partner to work with and even when we had our differences we laughed it off  and compromised. 
I loved Alon’s music and would add it to my personal mixtape https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86LqlzZvkRI Link right there. 
Anyways all in all I loved this project and I would happily do this again!
