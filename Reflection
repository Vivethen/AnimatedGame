I feel like I contributed a lot and did everything to the best of my ability, 
I genuinely loved working on the game and would do it again in the future. 
A lot of the time I wished I could’ve done more at home. 
Only last saturday did I code 2 bosses that didn’t end up in the final showing of the game which made me mad at first but I cooled off and noticed that they were very complicated. 
Viv was a great partner to work with and even when we had our differences we laughed it off  and compromised. 
I loved Alon’s music and would add it to my personal mixtape https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86LqlzZvkRI Link right there. 
Anyways all in all I loved this project and I would happily do this again!
