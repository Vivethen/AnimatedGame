- I believe that I have done the best of my ability for this project

- I got the github gift card from you for the most hours spent on khan academy because I spent a lot of my time at home learning about code and making my group’s game better.

- Even though the course is over I will still try to improve the game on my spare time over the summer.

- I have shown the game to some of my friends and cousins and put their feedback into the game

- I like how our game was able to use Alon’s music. I would like to add more sound effects like when you lose a life, kill an enemy or boss. Different music for the 5 different stages would be nice as well

Thanks for a great year, I hope to have you as my teacher in my future courses!
